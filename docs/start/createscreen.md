# Create a screen

## View contract

The first step is to create the view contract of the screen.

1. Create an interface ScreenNameVC.kt in the your.package.name.screens package.
   This interface must inherit from SKScreenVC.

Example : 

```kotlin
interface ScreenNameVC : SKScreenVC {
    var welcomeText : String
    var btStartApp : SkButtonVC
}
```

In this sample, we have a screen with a textview displaying a welcome text, and a button to start App. We use a Skbutton available in the Framework, and for the textview, we used a string.

2. Add a SKOpens annotation on the view contract of the screen that will launch your new screen and pass it the class of your view contract.
   Example : 
   
   ```kotlin
   @SKOpens([ScreenNameVC::class])
   interface SplashVC : SkScreenVC {
    var welcomeText : String
    var btStartApp : SkButtonVC
   }
   ```

3. launch the generation with the gradle command ***skGenerate***. The framework has generated code for you, and especially a viewModel and a view class
